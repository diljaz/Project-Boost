# Project-Boost

Project Boost is a 3D obstacle course game developed using the Unity game engine and C# scripting. The game challenges players to navigate a rocket through various obstacles and challenges to reach the finish line in each level.

## Game Overview

In Project Boost, players take control of a rocket and must guide it through an intricate 3D environment filled with obstacles, challenges, and collectibles. The goal is to successfully navigate the rocket through each level and reach the finish line as quickly as possible.

The game features the following key elements:

1. **Obstacle Navigation**: Players must carefully maneuver the rocket to avoid and overcome various obstacles, such as rotating platforms, moving barriers, and destructible elements.
2. **Power-ups and Collectibles**: Along the way, players can collect power-ups and other items that provide temporary boosts, such as increased speed, damage resistance, or extra fuel.
3. **Challenging Levels**: The game includes multiple levels, each with its own unique layout and set of challenges, increasing in difficulty as the player progresses.
4. **Leaderboard**: Players can compete against each other by trying to achieve the fastest completion times for each level, with their scores being recorded on a global leaderboard.
